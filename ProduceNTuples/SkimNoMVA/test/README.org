  #+end_src
 - A dummy python with (maybe) the minimum python fragments. I name it
   [[./dummy.py][=dummy.py=]].
 - A script to run remotely. I named it [[./run.sh][=run.sh=]].
** TODO A few tests [2/4]
- [X] It seems that I cannot do =ls job_input_file_list_*.txt=. I cannot
  find the content. I can try to dump the file names in
  =process.source.fileNames=.
- [-] Is it fast to read the file locally? [1/2]
  - [X] Write a test section for it
  - [ ] Test output: 4 seconds from CERN to connect T2_BR_SPRACE.
- [X] Is it CMSSW ENV available in =run.sh=? [2/2]
  - [X] Write a test section for it.
  - [X] Test output: CMSSW is OK. But OpenHF2020 not in the
    tarball. Need to ship it by myself.
- [-] Do compilation and run script. [1/2]
  - [X] Write the compilation code
  - [ ] Write the code to run ROOT macro. A tricky thing is that how
    to find =skimTree.cc=. Maybe I should use ~${OPENHF2020TOP}~?
